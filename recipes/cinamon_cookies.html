                <li>Half cup butter softened.</li>

                Here are the steps you need to follow.
            </h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Sift together all-purpose floor, baking soda and salt in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Beat together butter and shortening using an electric mixer in another bowl until combined; add sugar and continue beating until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Pour in eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour in flour mixture and blend until batter is smooth.</li>
                <li>Dust a work surface with flour and roll out cookie dough with a floured rolling pin into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Sprinkle cinnamon generously over the dough. Roll up the dough gently into a log starting on one of the long sides. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Unwrap the dough log and carefully slice into 1/4-inch pieces without smashing down the cookie. Place on an ungreased baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden around the edges, about 12 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
