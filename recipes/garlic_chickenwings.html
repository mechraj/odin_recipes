        </p>

        <p>So lets get started. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients Required:  </h2>
        <p>For the base of the wings:</p>
       
        <ul>
            <li>
                Wings – 2 pounds, which is about 20-24 wings (make sure the tips are removed and drumettes are separated)
            </li>
            <li>
                Avocado Oil – 1 tablespoon (You can also use any olive oil)
            </li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper  – to taste</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>
            As for the sauce, soy-garlic-ginger is one tasty combination that fuses all the right asian flavors together. It’s sweet, tangy, and the fresh garlic and ginger give it a punch of flavor. To make the sauce, just gather together these ingredients:
        </p>
       
        <ul>
            <li>
                Honey– 1/2 cup
            </li>
            <li>
                Soy Sauce – 1/4 cup (I’ve used Tamari for gluten-free soy sauce and you could use coconut aminos as well)
            </li>
            <li>
                Garlic Cloves – 4 large cloves minced
            </li>
            <li>
                Ginger – 1 tablespoon finely diced fresh ginger
            </li>
            <li>
                Water – 1/4 cup
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Getting started with the recipe.</h2>
        <p>
            So we got the required ingredients. Lets get started.
        </p>
        <p>Once you’ve prepped your wings, simply pop them in the oven, make the sauce while you’re waiting, then toss them together.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove any moisture from the chicken wings using a paper towel to blot.
            </li>
            <li>Toss the wings with oil, salt and pepper in a large mixing bowl. 
            </li>
            <li>
                On a wire rack, spread the wings out into a single layer. Make sure to place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet first, then place the wire rack on top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 45-50 minutes, until crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the wings are cooking, make the sauce. Add the honey, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and water to a small pot. Bring it to a boil and reduce the heat to a low setting and let it simmer and reduce for about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool. Note that it will continue to thicken as it cools.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove wings from the oven and toss them in the sauce. Then place them back into the oven on the wire rack and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you have any leftover sauce you can coat the chicken wings again or serve it as a dipping sauce!
        </p>
